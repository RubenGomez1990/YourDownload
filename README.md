Problems:

1. Downloading video Error 404. 
Looked at google/reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/comments/15oyh34/ytdlp_http_error_403_forbidden/
I had a problem with my version of yt-dlp. Used yt-dlp -U to update it. Now it works. Tried with this video: https://youtu.be/8xQbWu9yzS0?si=0HlMMsDTzjpIrONT
